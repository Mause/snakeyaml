SnakeYAML was created in late 2008 from JvYaml 0.2.1 with an intention
to implement a reference YAML parser for Java.
 	
The PRIMARY AUTHORS are (and/or have been):
 	
* Andrey Somov <py4fun@gmail.com>
 	
And here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who have submitted patches, reported bugs, added translations, helped
answer newbie questions, and generally made SnakeYAML that much better:

Kirill Simonov <xi@resolvent.net> - for writing the original Python code.
Ola Bini <ola@ologix.com> - for porting PyYAML to Java
